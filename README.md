# Marvel

I have used several technologies in this project

-- Infinite Scroll
     if you scroll at the end of the page new characters and comics will be shown on the site 
-- React Router
     by clicking on the 'characters'  and 'comics' links you can travel through website. And by clicking on the 'Marvel' logo you can come back to the main page
-- Search Engine
    by typing the name of the character that you want to find on the search bar , you can get the information about him.
-- Randomizer
    by clikcing the 'try it ' button you can get the random character and a little info about him \
-- Tab , Enter
   by pressing the 'Tab' you can go through all items on website and by pressing the 'Enter' key you can choose item.
